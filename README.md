First major update to app. Consisting of creating the file and folder structure for the app. 
All basic routes are in place. Note that only some of the image references are updated. I haven't done all of these yet as they will become dynamic in the future so it's probably just better to update them with the final references. Some limited nav bar features are enabled also (but they are not relative so they are circular at present).
